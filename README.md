###Installation

Installing JobsLite is very simple. Just drag and drop JobsLite into your "mods" folder along with Sponge and start your server. The configuration file can be found in `config/JobsLite/config.conf`.

**Dependencies:** JobsLite requires an economy plugin that uses the Sponge Economy API.
